The invention also offers for polynucleotide sequences comprising fragments of SEQ ID NO: 10299. In one embodiment, the polynucleotide fragment does not consist completely of a known polynucleotide sequence of a SARS virus or a recognized polynucleotide sequence of a coronavirus. SEQ ID NO: 10033 or a identified coronavirus polynucleotide sequence or a known SARS polynucleotide sequence. SARS virus polynucleotide or amino acid sequence or of a known coronavirus polynucleotide or amino acid sequence. The invention further features a polypeptide comprising amino acid sequence QRT and further comprising a first amino acid sequence previous to the N-terminus of the sequence QRT. FIG. 120F e.g. SEQ ID NO S : 10183 to 10209. Within FIG. 120F the following amino acid sequence beginning with a Met and ending at a cease codon could be identified: SEQ ID NO: 10187. Accordingly, the invention includes a polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10187, or a fragment thereof or an amino acid sequence having sequence identity thereto.</p><p>Accordingly, the invention features a protein comprising amino acid sequence QRT.

Hence, on this paper, the efficacy of two polyelectrolyte polymers, namely poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and polyacrylamide (PAM), as corrosion inhibitors for copper in molar nitric acid medium was explored. SEQ ID NO: 10210 additionally incorporates two predicted glycosylation websites at amino acids 81-84 (NNTE; SEQ ID NO: 10218) and at 180-183 (NHSV; SEQ ID NO: 10219). Accordingly, the invention includes a polypeptide comprising a fragment of SEQ ID NO: 10210, whereby mentioned fragment features a glycosylation site. SEQ ID NO: 10015 encodes two stop codons at its C-terminus ( FIG. 113 ). The corresponding region from the BNI-1 sequence does not include this fifty four mer. SEQ ID NO: 9968 encodes amino acid sequence SEQ ID NO: 10022, adopted by a cease codon at its C-terminus. SEQ ID NO: 10220, SEQ ID NO: 10221, SEQ ID NO: 10222, SEQ ID NO: 10223, SEQ ID NO: 10224, SEQ ID NO: 10225, SEQ ED NO: 10226 and SEQ ID NO: 10227, or a fragment thereof or an amino acid sequence having sequence identity thereto.
